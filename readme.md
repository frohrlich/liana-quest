A simple turn-based game made with Phaser 3.

To compile the project, just run :

```
npm install
npm start
```

You can then launch the game via a simple live server (like the one from VSCode).

A demo is also available on the associated Github Page :
https://frohrlich.github.io/phaser-rpg/
(based on the 'demo' branch)
